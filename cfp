Since its earliest days almost all content on the Web has been made available 'for free' to large numbers of consumers. However, the content producers, like anyone, like to be paid for their work. To square this circle, content is often supported by advertising. It's a business model that has proved massively successful for some Web sites/services but is less so for others.
This seemingly simple landscape turns out to be not to be simple at all. Users are, rightly, concerned about their privacy. Advertisers are concerned that their ads are delivered to an appropriate audience. Everyone is concerned about security and integrity. Ad blockers are common place and popular with end users for obvious reasons and yet they pose an existential threat to the services those users enjoy.
To address these issues, W3C, in collaboration with GS1 and the Interactive Advertising Bureau, invites you to a (workshop|symposium|??) that will aim to identify steps that can and should be taken by different stakeholders to:
* improve the user experience;
* improve the integrity and security of online advertising;
* utilize the Web platform to greatest effect in linking advertised products and services with potential customers to increase the effectiveness of online campaigns;
* create a more positive environment for users, Web site owners and advertisers.
The workshop is open to everyone and will take place at @@@, Toronto.
