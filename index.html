    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
	  Advertisers, Web site owners (publishers), ad technology
	  companies, end users, browser makers, Web designers,
	  analytics and analysis people, network security people,
	  we all have different views of Web advertising and we all
	  use slightly differing terminology, or the same terminology
	  but from different perspectives.</p>
      <p>
	  This document tries to give a combined view.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="a">
    <h2>A</h2>
<dl>
<dt>A/B Testing</dt>
<dd>Comparing two versions. In Web advertising it's most commonly used to
test two different Web page layouts or two different ads, by showing
each to a randomly selected half of visitor and measuring which does
best.
</dd>

<dt>Above the Fold</dt>
<dd>The part of a Web page that can be seen without scrolling; this
obviously varied by device. It originally came from print newspapers,
which are comonly sold folded in half so that only the top part of the
front page is visible before purchase.
</dd>

<dt>Account-based Advertising</dt>
<dd>The practice of micro-targeting (q.v.) based on job title, managerial
level or similar attributes of people in a target account such as a
large corporation.
</dd>

<dt>Ad Blocker</dt>
<dd>A Web browser add-on that hides ads on Web pages the user visits is
called an Ad Blocker. Some of these can block ads in video sites as
well as in HTML pages; it's also common for some sort of privacy
features to be included to prevent Behavioural Targeting.
</dd>

<dt>Ad Click</dt>
<dd>User response to an ad, e.g. by pressing it or clicking on it.
</dd>

<dt>Ad Completion</dt>
<dd>When a video ad plays all the way to the end.
</dd>

<dt>Ad Exchange</dt>
<dd>An automated marketplace where an auction is held each time an ad is
requested for a Web page to provide the ad that will pay th emost money
per ad click or per ad impression.
</dd>

<dt>Ad Fraud</dt>
<dd>Attempts to cheat the system, such as running malicious ads that
pretend to be from one company but actually when clicked take users to
a phihing site, or, more commonly, publisher fraud happens when a Web
page reloads excessivly or has hiden ads users don't see, to get
advertisers to pay them or to simulate a high number of pageviews.
</dd>

<dt>Ad impression</dt>
<dd>A single ad being shown to a single user on one Web page is called an
impression. It can be difficult to measure when an ad has been shown,
but the Intersection Observer specification provides a mechanism to do
this. Has an ad been shown when 90% of it was on screen? Probably.

Some advertisers pay per impression, for example for Display
Advertising (qv).
</dd>

<dt>Ad Inventory</dt>
<dd>A Web Publisher's ad inventory is the number of Ad Impressions the
publisher has available to sell each month.
</dd>

<dt>Ad Network</dt>
<dd>An organization that supplies adverts to fill Ad Slots on Web pages. Ad
Networks typically connect large numbers of Web sites with large
numbers of advertisers, increasing the Audience for the advertiser and
the range of ads for the Publisher.
</dd>

<dt>Ad Serving</dt>
<dd>The process of delivering ads from an Ad Channel or a publisher's Web
server to the client browser.
</dd>

<dt>Ad Targeting</dt>
<dd>The process of delivering ads based on information about the person
viewing the containing Web page. See also Behavioral Targeting,
Contextual Targeting, and Geographic Targeting.
</dd>

<dt>Ad Tech</dt>
<dd>Avertising Technology: the entire range of systems, technologies and
services that are involved in the Web advertising industry.
</dd>

<dt>Ad Unit</dt>
<dd>Web pages that show ads generally have one or more Ad Slots, each of
which must be one of a particular set of sizes in pixels; a design of
an ad to fit such a slot is called an Ad Unit. When a Web page is
displayed, the Ad Network will supply an ad that meets the Ad Unit
specification for each slot in turn, with data such as pixel size,
colours, fonts and so forth. The IAB (q.v.) keeps a set of commonly-
used sizes for Ad Units.
</dd>

<dt>Affiliate Marketing</dt>
<dd>This is where Web publishers sign up with retailers and get paid when
users click through an ad to the retailer and make a purchase.
</dd>

<dt>Agency Trading Desk</dt>
<dd>(not sure)
</dd>

<dt>Analytics</dt>
<dd>Statistics about who uses a particular Web site: at its simplist this
can just provide total numer of users (Pageviews, q.v.) or users per
page over a given period; more sophisticated analytics might combine
Behavioral Targeting information to give information about visitor age
groups, location, gender and so forth, as well as how much time people
spend on the Web site,how they progress from page to page through the
site, which other sites they visit, and more.
</dd>

<dt>Attribution</dt>
<dd>Ientifying which contact with a user led to a sale, for the purpose of
estimating ROI (q.v.) For example, a user might have been exposed to an
email campaign, or received a telephone call, or seen an Web ad.

First-touch Attribution is when the first contact is assumed to be
responsible for the sale; last-touch gives the most recent contact just
before the ale the entire credit for the sale; multi-touch is more
realistic and shares the credit over the various contacts, but is
harder to calculate.
</dd>

<dt>Audience</dt>
<dd>Also known as Ad Audience. The total group of people that might have
seen a particuar ad in a given time period, often expressed as a
number.
</dd>

<dt>Audience Extension</dt>
<dd>See "Lookalike Modeling".
</dd>

<dt>Audio</dt>
<dd>There are guidelines from the IAB (q.v.) about when sound can be played
without specific opt-in from the user.

     <dt>Banner Ad</dt>
     <dd>Popularly, a banner ad is an advert at the top of a Web page
       characterized by being page-wide and not very tall (assuming a Western
       page layout, that is). People have learned to ignore them.
       Banner ads are usually used for
       display advertising
       to promote brand awareness. Cf. banner blindness.
     </dd>
     
     <dt>Banner Blindness</dt>
     <dd>Web site users have learned to ignore the top 100 or so pixels
       of Web sites because of the overuse of
       Banner Ads.</dd>
     
     <dt>Behavioural Targeting</dt>
     <dd>The practice of serving more specific advertisements to
       Web users by tracking them. For example, someone who has
       previously used loyalty cards to get points with purchases
       might be shown speical offers with a discount if a loyalty
       cardis used, to encourage them to buy more. Behavioural Targeting
       is often considered objectionable expecially by more
       sophisticated users, who worry about what exactly is known about
       them and by whom.
     </dd>
     
     <dt>Between-Page Ads</dt>
     <dd>See
       Interstitial Advertising.
     </dd>
     
     <dt>Bounce Rate</dt>
     <dd>The proportion of visitors to a Web page who look at a single
       page and then leave. A high bounce rate can that mean everyone clicked on
       an ad or that people found what they wanted,
       but more likely suggests problems with the page design not leading
       visitors to engage with the site.
     </dd>
     
     <dt>Brand</dt>
     <dd>In marketing, a brand is something that consumers recognize, such as
       a line of products with a distinctive name and coordinated appearance.
       The coordination is usually created with a mixture of company and product
       logos, designs, colours, fonts and layout. The term originated with
       indelible heat-marks used on sheep, cattle, and even humans, to show
       ownership.
     </dd>
     
     <dt>Brand Awareness</dt>
     <dd>The proportion of people (typically in a randomly selected consumer survey)
       who can identify a product based on the design of the marketing. See also
       Display Advertising,
       whose goal is generally to increase Brand Awareness in people.
     </dd>
     
     <dt>Brand Lift</dt>
     <dd>The increase in
       Brand Awareness
       that can be measured in people after a marketing campaign.</dd>

      <dt>Click-Through</dt>
      <dd>When users follow an advert on a Web page to get to the
        advertiser's Web site landing page, they are said to click though.</dd>
      
      <dt>Click-Through Rate</dt>
      <dd>The number of times people clicked on an ad (or touched it, on
        a mobile device) out of every hundred ad impressions.
        A CTR of 1% is considered reasonable for targeted, contextual advertising;
        a CTR of 0.1% is considered high for untargeted advertising.</dd>
      
      <dt>Contextual Targeting</dt>
      <dd>The process of choosing which ad to show somoeone based on
        the content of the Web page in which the ad will appear.
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Conversion Rate</dt>
      <dd>Conversion, in sales, is the act of turning someone from a
        prospective customer (propoect) or lead into an actual
        customer: they bought something. In Web advertising, then,
        conversion rate is the percentage of visitors who take
        a particular action, such as making a purchase or signing up for
        a newsletter.</dd>
      
      <dt>Cookie</dt>
      <dd>A Cookie is an example of a piece of data that a Web server can
        send over HTTP for a User Agent (a Web Browser) to store; the user
        agent will include the cookie in all subsequent HTTP requests from
        the same domain, even in subsequent browser sessions months later.
        This enables the Web server to recognise the visitor; see Tracking
        and Fingerprinting.</dd>
      
      <dt>Cost Per Action</dt>
      <dd>Ads that are paid for only when people buy something or sign
        up for something or create an account or perform someother
        specific action are called cost per-action (CPA).
      Note, CPA can also be cost per acquisition - that is, gaining
      a new customer.</dd>
      
      <dt>Cost Per Cick</dt>
      <dd>The amount of money charged to an advertiser by an ad channel when
        a user clicks on an ad;
        this is usually less than the amount paid to the Web site owner by
        the same channel, the difference being the ad channel's costs and profit.
      See also Effective CPM.</dd>
      
      <dt>Cost per Impression</dt>
      <dd>Advertising priced by the number of times it is shown to users;
        measured by the thousand impressions (mille), hence CPM. Note
        that if an ad is off-screen because the user hasn't scrolled down the
        page to it, it may or may not be charged. The W3C Intersection Observer
        specification helps determine whether an ad has been seen.</dd>
      
      <dt>Cost per lead</dt>
      <dd>Ad model in which the price depends on how many contacts were harvested.</dd>
        
      <dt>Customer Lifetime Value</dt>
      <dd>Value here is usually measured in money, and so this represents the
        total revenue from a single customer for the whole time they are
        a customer of some particular organization. Customer lifetime value (CLV) may
        or may not be expanded to include indirect revenue such as referrals and
        their CLV in turn.</dd>

   <dt>Display Advertising</dt>
<dd><p>Web ads that are intended to promote a brand rather than any particular
product; sometimes there's no specific action on an Ad Click, since the
  primary coal is just to increase awareness of the brand.</p>

<p>Display ads are almost always graphcal rather than simply text; if they
are textual it will generally be with an eye=catching font. The term
comes from print newspapers, where Display Ads are inserted alongside
  text articles.</p>

        <dt>Effective CPM (eCPM)</dt>
        <dd>Total earnings divided by thousands of impressions. If an advertiser bought
          cost per action advertising, for example, the eCPM value would be the cost as if
          they had bought cost per impression advertising.</dd>

        <dt>Fingerprinting</dt>
        <dd>Some Web pages run code to try and identify a user's computer,
          for example by the particular set of installed fonts and other
          characteristics that tend to vary only slowly over time. Others
          even try to use facial recognition. The goal is to detect when a visitor
          returns to a Web site, and to correlate the sites they visit; see Tracking.</dd>

            that is designed to look like regular content but has the
            goal of selling a product or service. It is usually
            included on the server, so that the HTML page is sent
            to the browser with the native ads already included and not
